# Java Client - Server Application With Software Design Patterns
This project demonstrates a Java-based client-server application utilizing the Mediator and Serializable design patterns for efficient communication and data handling.

## Overview
The application enables clients to send text lines to the server, which then performs circular shifting and alphabetical sorting before returning the processed results back to the clients. Key features include:

- **Mediator Pattern**:  Centralizes communication and coordination between client and server components.
  
- **Serializable Pattern**: Facilitates object serialization for network transmission.
  
- **Text Processing**: Implements circular shifting and alphabetical sorting algorithms within the Mediator pattern.

## Technology Used
**Java** Core Programming language for both client and server implementation.

**This project not only demonstrates core Java skills but also highlights advanced concepts in software design patterns and network communication protocols.**
